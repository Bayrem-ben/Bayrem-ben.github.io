        <p>Ferrari arrive in Mugello to celebrate their 1,000th Grand Prix on the back of two point-less weekends at Spa and Monza. But Charles Leclerc was optimistic that the team would perform better this weekend at the Mugello track the team have owned since 1988.

Ferrari’s cars will bear a special burgundy livery for the Gran Premio Della Toscana Ferrari 1000, as the team celebrate their 1,000 Formula 1 race – with the first having come at the 1950 Monaco Grand Prix.

But after failing to finish higher than 14th at the Belgian Grand Prix, before crashing out of a potentially promising fourth place at the Italian Grand Prix last weekend, how did Leclerc feel Ferrari’s jubilee race was likely to pan out?

“I have a feeling that it might be better than the last two weekends for us performance-wise,” Leclerc said on Thursday. “I really hope tomorrow will confirm what I think, but it should be a bit more positive and let’s see how it goes. Physically, we’ve done a filming day a few months ago here. To restart on a track like this was pretty difficult for the neck, but it should be fine because we’ve had quite a lot of races since then.”</p>

        <p>It was perhaps the most unexpected result in the turbo-hybrid era of F1 as Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull all failed to make the podium in a thrilling race at Monza - and Pierre Gasly negotiated the chaos superbly to take his first ever Formula 1 victory.

The French driver benefited from a ten second stop/go penalty handed to early leader Lewis Hamilton, but then put in the race of his life as he fended off a long attack from Carlos Sainz to take the win, with the Spaniard less than half a second behind the AlphaTauri at the flag.

Lance Stroll joined Gasly and Sainz on the podium on a day when it all went wrong for the so-called 'Big Three' of Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari.
